# Sleep Timer

This is a basic batch command file that's executed through python after a timer is set. Once ran will put computer to sleep after desired amount of time is completed. Now has a basic gui for the timer.

Created primarily because if you are watching Netflix/Hulu/etc the screen stays on because it's considered still active. This program overwrites that functionality in order for you to fall asleep while your desired method of entertainment is on.
